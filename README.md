# gta-ahk
A simple set of AHK macros that can be used in GTA Online, mainly pvp oriented. The purpose of the repository is to act as storage. **This repo is currently outdated and not maintained; broken by changes made to the game's interaction menu.** However, the main structure and configuration is still usable and may provide a good starting point for anyone still willing to make the necessary updates.
## How to use
When you want to run the macro, right-click main.ahk and press "Run with AHK". You might have to start the macro *after* the GTA window has opened completely for it to work. Otherwise, just reload the script.
